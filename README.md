## Front-end : Flutter web/android/ios
  For personal reason(不定期咕咕咕),upload previous qq mini app source to /CakeWorld/qq. If any 肝帝 folks want to continue this project , he/she can use the existing front-end UI design and assets(@https://github.com/difuer-yl)
## Back-end 
  After consideration , graphQL/ApiJSON etc. might slightly ugly for this lightweight situation. For exploration , Faas/Serverless based on Cloud provider capabilities seems more perfect.
  Will try some demo based on Tencent Cloud SCF
